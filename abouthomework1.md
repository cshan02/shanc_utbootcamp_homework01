Hello,
This is my first homework at the UofT Bootcamp.
In this homework, we explored how to make the website more accessible and to make an excellent structural coding layout. 
This is an on-going project, and I will update it more once I get the feedback from the instructor. 

Cheers,
Cordelia Shan
